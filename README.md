# Verification-Project

How to run?
1. Open the project with Intellij
2. Create Run/Debug configuration with the following properties:
    > Name: SphereInterval
    > Main class: tau.verification.sphereInterval.Main
    > Program arguments: -cp .\test -pp -f J SphereIntervalTest
3. Run 'SphereInterval' configuration


Keep in mind
1. Java 1.7 is required
2. We work with Intellij. It shouldn't be complicated to setup with other IDEs/environments.
